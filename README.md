# hello-world
#Starting out to code!

#I am super noob coder thats going to be presuing a carrer in software development. I will be starting to earn my bacholers degree here in the coming months. I will be posting some random coding exercises as I learn how to code. I will be learning python as my first programming language, though a couple of years ago I taught my self HTML. Though with HTML I quickly forgot because I never practiced it.
